# Implementation Analytics Portfolio – Aviation Operations

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of business rules and
operational analytics to support airport resource planning decisions.
The focus is on translating operational requirements into system-ready
logic and validating outcomes through data analysis.

## Business Problem
Airport managers must understand aircraft size distribution and delay
patterns to optimize gate assignment, staffing levels, and boarding
operations.

## Implementation Approach
- Defined business rules for aircraft size classification
- Implemented delay status binning logic using standardized thresholds
- Calculated operational metrics to support planning decisions
- Validated findings to ensure logic could be applied consistently

## Artifacts
- **/documentation** – Implementation narrative and executive summary
- **/sql** – SQL logic supporting implemented business rules
- **/visuals** – Supporting charts and outputs (optional)

## Tools Used
- SQL (SQLite/PostgreSQL compatible)
- Microsoft Word (documentation)
- GitHub (version control and portfolio hosting)

## Key Takeaway
This project emphasizes implementation readiness, validation, and
stakeholder-focused documentation rather than exploratory analytics
alone.
