# Implementation Analytics Portfolio – Aviation Operations

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of business rules and
operational analytics to support airport resource planning decisions.
The focus is on translating operational requirements into system-ready
logic and validating outcomes through data analysis.

## Business Problem
Airport managers must understand aircraft size distribution and delay
patterns to optimize gate assignment, staffing levels, and boarding
operations.

## Implementation Approach
- Defined business rules for aircraft size classification
- Implemented delay status binning logic using standardized thresholds
- Calculated operational metrics to support planning decisions
- Validated findings to ensure logic could be applied consistently

## Artifacts
- **/documentation** – Implementation narrative and executive summary
- **/sql** – SQL logic supporting implemented business rules
- **/visuals** – Supporting charts and outputs (optional)

## Tools Used
- SQL (SQLite/PostgreSQL compatible)
- Microsoft Word (documentation)
- GitHub (version control and portfolio hosting)

## Key Takeaway
This project emphasizes implementation readiness, validation, and
stakeholder-focused documentation rather than exploratory analytics
alone.

Flight Operations Delay Risk Dashboard
Project Overview

This project analyzes flight delay patterns by aircraft size to assess operational risk and identify where delay severity has the greatest impact. The dashboard is designed to support operational decision-making by highlighting delay frequency, worst-case scenarios, and overall risk classification across aircraft categories.

Key Findings

Large aircraft exhibit the highest delay severity and operational risk, driven by extreme worst-case delay events.

Delay risk increases with aircraft size, with small aircraft showing the most consistent on-time performance.

Worst-case delays contribute more to operational risk than flight volume alone, particularly for large aircraft.

Medium aircraft demonstrate controlled delay exposure, resulting in moderate but manageable risk.

Small aircraft delays remain operationally manageable, with limited variability and minimal disruption.

Dashboard Highlights

Interactive slicer to analyze delays by aircraft size

Risk status indicator driven by delay severity thresholds

Average delay comparison across aircraft categories

Delay distribution analysis to identify variability and outliers

Worst-case delay metrics to support risk-based decision-making

Tools and Skills Used

Power BI (DAX, slicers, filter context, card visuals)

Data modeling and transformation

Operational analytics and risk assessment

Dashboard UX and visual design

Business Value

This dashboard demonstrates how operational delay data can be translated into actionable risk insights, enabling stakeholders to prioritize mitigation efforts for aircraft categories most susceptible to severe disruptions.

Notes

This project emphasizes clarity, restrained visual design, and alignment between analytical findings and visual outputs to ensure insights remain defensible and decision-focused.
